### Hi there

Developer and system architect building applied AI for health-tech.

#### Current Project: Niblink (Trigger Detective)

A hybrid AI + deterministic system helping Hashimoto's patients find hidden
dietary triggers.

- **The problem**: Autoimmune food reactions are delayed 24-72 hours — impossible
  to track manually
- **The approach**: AI handles perception (food photos → ingredients) while a
  statistical engine handles the correlation math — no hallucinated medical advice
- **The data**: Integrated with official German nutrition databases (BLS + DGE)
  for grounded, accurate analysis

**Stack**: .NET 8 · Vue 3 · TypeScript · Tailwind · SQLite · PWA
